                <p>
                    Ilya is blind. She is the chief accountant at an insurance
                    company (...) and like many other blind computer users, she
                    does not read Braille.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ilya uses a screen reader and mobile phone to access the
                    web. (...) Ilya encounters problems when websites are not
                    properly coded and do not include alt text descriptions on
                    images. These sites are unnavigable and require large
                    amounts of time to read text from the top of the page to the
                    bottom without navigation cues. Occasionally she finds
                    herself trapped in areas on a webpage unable to move to
                    another area and must abandon the page altogether.
