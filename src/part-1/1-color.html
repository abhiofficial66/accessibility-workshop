                <p>
                    Lee is colorblind and encounters barriers when shopping
                    online. (...) When red and green color combinations are
                    used, Lee cannot distinguish between the two, since both
                    look brown to him. It is also very difficult for him to make
                    product choices when color swatches are not labeled with the
                    name of the color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lee has better experiences with online content and apps that
                    use adequate contrast and allow him to adjust contrast
                    settings in his browser. He is also better able to recognize
                    when information is required when asterisks are used. Lee
                    can more easily identify the products he would like to
                    purchase, especially clothing, when the color label names
                    are included in the selection options rather than color
                    swatches alone
